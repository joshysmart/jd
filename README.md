# JD - A personal health assistant built with Django

I took on this project while learning and experimenting with Django. Despite encountering difficulties, I found the experience fulfilling. As I move forward, my goal is to expand upon my understanding of this framework and refine my abilities. [Jd health assistant](http://joshysmart.pythonanywhere.com). is deployed on [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)

## Overview

### The challenge

Completing the project was a challenging task, but I found inspiration from different sources. One of the primary sources of inspiration was the Ada health assistant app on Android, which I used as a reference for the design files I created using Figma. However, since it was my first Django project, there were numerous challenging aspects to it. Nevertheless, I realized that Django has an exceptional and secure authentication and admin system, although customizing it requires considerable effort.

Users are able to

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on the device's screen size
- Get authenticated
- Add profiles i.e, other users. You don't have to go through the signup process again
- Search for symptoms
- Fill out all necessary fields I tried to keep it brief, even though a typical health assistant is required to ask lots of questions to improve accuracy
- Receive form validations if fields are missing (I might still need to work on this)
- See correct symptom details and list of symptoms based on their search
- **Bonus**: I will try to expand this a little bit, there's still room for improvement.

## My process
### Built with
- Django (pretty cool framework, considering I've been working with react/nextjs)
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind CSS (ðŸ«¡)
- Flexbox (No grid this time)
- Mobile-first workflow
- dbsqlite3
- Api medic 

### What I learned

A lot. I practiced using Django, the medical resources alone are very nice for anyone to just wants to browse through, I got a lot of help from friends at discord too.

### Continued development

As a computer scientist, this is not the end of this project or Django. I will keep doing what I love. I wanted to try ML for this but the API already uses it and it would have been too complicated at this stage

Coming next is a task management app from [frontend-mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges).

### Useful resources
- [Dango tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/) - I kept referring to this website, anything I didn't understand I took to their discord channel.
- [Stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - of course
- [Wesbos Ajax typeahead js30 feature](https://courses.wesbos.com/)
