# JD - A personal health assistant built with Django

This was a project I picked up while learning and experimenting with Django, it was quite challenging considering, I hope to continue working with this framework and improve on it. [Jd health assistant](http://joshysmart.pythonanywhere.com). I deployed this project on [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)

## Overview

### The challenge

I challenged myself on this one, although I must say I had a little inspiration from here and there. Ada health assistant app on android is my major source of inspiration, I took a screenshot of their app and created my design files with Figma and all that. But it was still quite challenging implementing some of the features, especially considering this is my first time working with Django. I must say Django provides a wonderful and secure authentication and admin system even though it eas a bit of a hassle to customize.

Users are able to

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on the device's screen size
- Get authenticated
- Add profiles i.e, other users. You don't have to go through the signup process again
- Search for symptoms
- Fill out all necessary fields I tried to keep it brief, even though a typical health assistant is required to ask lots of questions to improve accuracy
- Receive form validations if fields are missed (I might still need to work on this)
- See correct symptom details and list of symptoms based on their search
- **Bonus**: I might try to expand this a little bit, there's still room for improvement but I might leave it at this for now

## My process

### Built with

- Django (pretty cool framework, considering I've been working with react/nextjs)
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind CSS (ðŸ«¡)
- Flexbox (No grid this time)
- Mobile-first workflow
- dbsqlite3
- Api medic (I really appreciate the opportunity)

### What I learned

A lot. I practiced using Django, the medical resources alone are very nice for anyone to just wants to browse through, I got a lot of help from friends at discord too.

### Continued development

I am a computer scientist. This is not the end of this project or Django. I'm gonna keep doing what I love. I wanted to try ML for this but the API already uses it and it would have been too complicated at this stage

Coming next is a task management app from [frontend-mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges).

I intend on making improvements to the site.

### Useful resources

- [Dango tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/) - I kept referring to this website, and anything I didn't understand I took to their discord channel.
- [Stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - of course
- [Wesbos Ajax typeahead js30 feature](https://courses.wesbos.com/) I need to mention this
